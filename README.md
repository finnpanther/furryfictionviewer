# Introduction; Who am I, What Is This, and Why
    
Hi. I am Finn Panther, and you stumbled onto the interactive novel program I accidentally wrote. I've been a writer for quite some. I've written a fair number of stories for the furry fandom under two handles: Finn Panther, and Skip Lyons. I also have a published webnovel as of May, 2022, also under the pen name Finn Panther.
    
Taking my hobby somewhat professional was an excellent experience, but one heck of a time commitment, and in part taught me that writing as a career just wasn't gonna cut it. I turned to learning programming as a fairly safe decision for getting a better job. An altogether more valuable use of time than throwing my all into writing books. I needed bigger, more reliable change. I got a little carried away.

A few weeks into learning, I decided that I might as well make a text based game. The principles of programming would surely carry into other aspects of the field, and it was a way to marry my love of writing with my interest in code. Not long into making this game, I realized that my creative writing could not sufficiently occur within the code itself. I wanted to write interactive narratives. Breaking that up into pieces, alongside hard coded game logic, just wasn't enough.

I ended up building a scene constructor which I think is fairly robust, to allow me to fluidly write an interactive narrative, with as minimal breaks in workflow as possible. Then I needed a somewhat involved system for reading that constructed scene. I decided that I might as well add a UI to make it pretty, or at least prettier than just command prompt. In all, when trying to make a text based game, I accidentally went all in on making an interactive fiction engine instead.

# Current State and Roadmap

At present, this is very much a work in progress. I have a lot of creative writing to do, in order to fill out the machine I wrote to facilitate it. As for the machine, and the upcoming fixes I intend to get to first:

- Color Fixes (at present, it is not particularly pleasing to see)
- Button Window Refinement (including color fixes, resizing of buttons, creating background to better distinguish the field)
- Text Improvements (spacing is inconsistent, formatting is inconsistent, text sizing needs addressing)
- Functionality for linking stories together, opposed to hard coding only one
(Not yet enough fiction to make this feature useful, or even possible)
- An .exe for ease of access until the game is properly launched

And Ultimately:
- An actual, explorable text-based world, from which to discover the interactive stories, opposed to merely reading the stories themselves
    
In time, the dream would be to more fully flesh out the program and upload it to a platform for easy consumption, something akin to Steam, or even the Google Play store. That stage of development is likely a long way out. There is a lot of program to write before it's ready for suuch a step, and not a lot of free time in which to write it. But it is a target on the roadmap all the same.

# How To Use It

I need to be honest here. I am new to programming myself. I am self taught, and the number of YouTube videos I watched to get this thing running is simply astronomical. To the veterans reading this; You know how to use this. It is built in Python, using the graphical library Kivy. With those installed, it should run perfectly fine.

For the novices among us: I'm afraid I don't have much help to give. If I understand correctly, you would need to have Python installed on your computer. I believe (I might have this wrong, so don't trust my word!) it is called an interpreted language, which means you install Python, and also a program which can read and write using it. I have used PyCharm and also VS Code, but there are millions of applications which work. You need also to install the graphical library Kivy. It is python specific, and is what I used to code the UI.

I might have gotten the details of that wrong. But until I make an executable of some sort, that's honestly the most helpful advice I can give. YouTube tutorials can get you there, if you REALLY wanted to check out my thing. Else, you could pester me to make it easier to access, which would definitely speed the process along.

# Closing Remarks

In short, thank you for checking out my code. I am QUITE new to programming. This is a project all of five months in the making, from first laying my eyes on booleans and getting wide-eyed at dictionaries and lists, to installing libraries and expanding the code in ways I'm not sure a novice was supposed to do. It's been a great headache, but extremely rewarding, and I'm pleased to announce that it's in a space where I'm comfortably finally letting it see the light of day.

It is very much a work in progress. There are tons of features I would like to add, and no doubt in the code you might find some odd solutions which took five lines of code, which could have been reduced to one. But, I'm learning. So, whether you're reading this and a novice, or reading this and you're a newbie like me - thanks for checking it out so far. There's definitely more on the way.
